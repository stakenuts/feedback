## Shelley Incentivised Testnet

This short document should document the feedback from the Shelley incentivised testnet.

### Last minute undelegation attack

### Delegation causality problem

Stake delegation to different pools is one of the main element that keeps the network stable and secure. Once
a bad player is in the game and is identified by the stake holders, the incentive for them is to redelegate to
honest players in order to keep the network stable and secure and therefore protect their interests. However, as 
we have seen during the Shelley incentivised testnet, a number of bad players were able to destabilize the network
by producing a lot of lot of different same leade blocks for one slot and forcing the network into a lot of forks. 

After the issue has gain publicity, the delegators, including IOHK, were able to switch their stake to different staking
pools but we unable to do so due to the network instability. Therefere the bad player owned the stake and the delegators were
not possibile to execute their incentives.
